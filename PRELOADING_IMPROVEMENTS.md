# Company Form Preloading Improvements

## Summary

This implementation addresses the requirement to ensure that the company registration and editing form preloads correctly with all available information by indexing and querying the latest registered information from the Companies (empresas), Representatives (representantes), and Guests (invitados) tables.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Database Queries
- **Latest Record Retrieval**: Modified all search queries to use `ORDER BY updated_at DESC, created_at DESC LIMIT 1` to ensure the most recent information is always retrieved
- **Complete Data Fetching**: Enhanced queries to fetch complete datasets with JOIN operations for cross-referenced information

### 2. Comprehensive Field Preloading
- **All Company Fields**: Now preloads all company fields including `numero_afiliacion`, `consejero_camara`, `direccion_fiscal`, `direccion_comercial`, `telefono_oficina`, `giro_comercial`
- **Representative Data**: Complete representative information including name, email, phone, and position
- **Checkbox Handling**: Proper handling of the `consejero_camara` checkbox field

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoints

#### Improved `buscarEmpresa` (RFC Search)
- Returns latest company and representative data
- Fallback to any representative if no primary contact exists

#### Enhanced `buscarPorEmail` (Email Search)
- Searches both guests and company representatives
- Returns complete company data when representative is found
- Proper separation of guest vs company representative data

#### New `buscarPorTelefono` (Phone Search)
- Comprehensive phone search across guests and representatives
- Returns complete company data when representative phone is found
- Enhanced cross-reference capability

### 4. Database Schema Enhancement
- **Added `consejero_camara` field**: New TINYINT(1) field in empresas table to track CANACO counselor status
- **Migration Script**: Provided for existing databases to add the missing field
- **Updated Schema**: Base schema updated for new installations

### 5. Improved JavaScript Functionality
- **Enhanced Field Mapping**: Complete mapping of all database fields to form fields
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved validation for field existence and option availability
- **Cross-Reference Loading**: When finding a representative via email/phone, also loads complete company data

## Technical Changes

### API Controller (`app/controllers/ApiController.php`)
- Enhanced `buscarEmpresa()` method with latest record logic
- Improved `buscarPorEmail()` method with complete company data return
- New `buscarPorTelefono()` method for comprehensive phone search
- Updated registration method to handle `consejero_camara` field

### JavaScript (`assets/js/app.js`)
- Enhanced `searchByRFC()` function with complete field preloading
- Improved `searchByEmail()` function with company data handling
- Enhanced `searchByPhone()` function with company data support
- Added checkbox handling for `consejero_camara`

### Database
- Added `consejero_camara` field to empresas table
- Created migration script for existing installations
- Updated base schema for new installations

### Routes (`index.php`)
- Added new `api/buscar-por-telefono` route

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with comprehensive form preloading scenarios:
- ✅ RFC search preloads all company and representative fields
- ✅ Email search finds representatives and preloads complete company data
- ✅ Phone search works for both guests and company representatives
- ✅ All fields including new `consejero_camara` checkbox are properly handled
- ✅ Latest record logic ensures most recent data is used

## Impact

- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Complete form preloading reduces manual data entry
- **Data Accuracy**: Latest record logic ensures most current information is used
- **Cross-Reference Capability**: Finding a representative now also loads company data
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All form fields are now properly preloaded

## Installation Notes

For existing installations, run the migration script:
```sql
-- Run this on existing databases
ALTER TABLE empresas ADD COLUMN consejero_camara TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER numero_afiliacion;
```

For new installations, the updated schema.sql includes all necessary fields.
